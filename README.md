# RL-CrypticX
My own Rocket League bot. The code for it is really a mess but planning to clean it up a bit.<br>
Some of the stuff is commented out due to breaking like dodging. 

## Installing the bot
> Download RLBotGUI using this [link](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotGUI/releases/download/v1.0/RLBotGUI.msi)
> When installed, you should get two windows pop up like this:

> Once, the program has installed its requirements needed for the bots to run
> Click on the button that says: "Add" then "Load Folder"<br>
> Now, find were you extracted the bot and click "Select Folder"

Enjoy playing with version 1 of my Rocket League bot
